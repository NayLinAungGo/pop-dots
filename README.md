# dotfiles deployed on my Pop\!\_OS system

- Includes configs for:
    - bash ( shell )
    - vim ( editor )
    - mpv ( media viewer )
    - zathura ( document viewer )
    - and other programs I use

- To be complaint with XDG Base Directory Specification:
    - All configs are in [`.config`](/.config)
    - Environment variables are set in [`.config/shell/profile`](/.config/shell/profile)

- dconf dumps:
    - Pop\!\_OS's uses dconf files for it's GNOME configurations
    - Useful dconf dumps relating to pop-shell configs, keybinds and gnome-terminal profile are stored in [`dconf`](/dconf)
