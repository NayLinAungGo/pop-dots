# dotfiles deployed on my Pop\!\_OS system

- Includes configs for:
    - bash ( shell )
    - vim ( editor )
    - mpv ( media viewer )
    - zathura ( document viewer )
    - and other programs I use

- To be complaint with XDG Base Directory Specification:
    - All configs are in [.config](/.config)
    - Environment variables are set in [.config/shell/profile](/.config/shell/profile)
